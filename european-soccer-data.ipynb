       "{'description': '25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football.\\n\\nThe ultimate Soccer database for data analysis and machine learning\\n\\nWhat you get:\\n\\n+25,000 matches\\n+10,000 players\\n11 European Countries with their lead championship\\nSeasons 2008 to 2016\\nPlayers and Teams\\' attributes* sourced from EA Sports\\' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates\\nTeam line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)\\nBetting odds from up to 10 providers\\nDetailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc...) for +10,000 matches\\n*16th Oct 2016: New table containing teams\\' attributes from FIFA !\\n\\nOriginal Data Source:\\n\\nYou can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier. I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from:\\n\\nhttp://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/ : scores, lineup, team formation and events\\nhttp://www.football-data.co.uk/ : betting odds. Click here to understand the column naming system for betting odds:\\nhttp://sofifa.com/ : players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games. FIFA series and all FIFA assets property of EA Sports.\\nWhen you have a look at the database, you will notice foreign keys for players and matches are the same as the original data sources. I have called those foreign keys \"api_id\".\\n\\nExploring the data:\\n\\nNow that\\'s the fun part, there is a lot you can do with this dataset. I will be adding visuals and insights to this overview page but please have a look at the kernels and give it a try yourself ! Here are some ideas for you:\\n\\nThe Holy Grail... ... is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I\\'ve achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game, you\\'ve got to know that the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision.\\n\\nProbabilities vs Odds\\n\\nWhen running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions.\\n\\nExplore and visualize features\\n\\nWith access to players and teams attributes, team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights into The Beautiful Game . Who knows, Guardiola himself may hire one of you some day!\\n\\nSource: Kaggle\\n\\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer',\n",
